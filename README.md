# ChipsChallenge
A clone of the Atari videogame Chip's Challenge. Written in Java and uses the Swing GUI framework. Created for a university group project.

## My Contribution
My contribution to the project involved implememnting the loading feature of the game. The game files are written in JSON, and the loading system I have implemented reads the JSON file and loads the level of the game accordingly.
