# ChapsChallenge

Implementation of a clone of the Atari videogame Chip's Challenge. Written in Java and includes usage of the Swing GUI framework. Was created for a university group project with four other students

## My Contribution
My contribution to the project involved implememnting the loading feature of the game. The game files are written in JSON, and the loading system I have implemented reads the JSON file and loads the level of the game accordingly.
